### Web Apps (frontend only)
----

##### [CircleCI](https://github.com/circleci/frontend)

* clojurescript, om, react
* Eclipse Public License

> CircleCI provides a continuous integration and deployment platform. The frontend is an impressive example of a large application built with the immutable data structures of clojurescript. The frontend integrates with pusher, intercom, d3, and google analytics and has a great example of navigation routing and communication via real-time events, websockets, and backend API servers. Its test suite is not that extensive but does provide a good example of how to test clojurescript/om apps using karma.



##### [The Guardian](https://github.com/guardian/frontend) 

* play2, scala, node
* Apache 2.0 License

> The guardian is a news site with subscriptions, sign in, search, an admin interface and a series of middleman scala apps that handle communication between the static frontends and backend APIs.
